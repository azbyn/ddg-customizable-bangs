how to build:

run `make genBang`

modify the bang.js as you want

run `make`

then inside your browser of choice find a way to install extensions from a local file
(in firefox go to Add-ons Manager and in the settings thing there's `Install Add-on From File...`)

you might get an error about a corrupt package
(read the comments in background.js for _some_ help)
